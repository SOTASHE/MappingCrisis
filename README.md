### Want to run your own instance of the app?  The requirements to build from source are:

- NodeJS/NPM
- First, clone the project repository
- cd to backend
- Run npm install 
to install dependencies for backend
- npm install
- Create Mongo DB https://account.mongodb.com/account/login?n=%2Fv2%2F6202fdff202c3f47248e22e6&nextHash=%23metrics%2FreplicaSet%2F621bc8efcad26071f1067943%2Fexplorer%2FMapping_Crisis%2Fcrisis%2Ffind
- Coonect to mongo db using your own Mongo API KEY,  Choose a connection method by selecting Connect your application. You will get the api key 
- Create a .env file and fill it with your MongoDB API key
- You can get these by
     Creating Mongo DB https://account.mongodb.com/account/login?       n=%2Fv2%2F6202fdff202c3f47248e22e6&nextHash=%23metrics%2FreplicaSet%2F621bc8efcad26071f1067943%2Fexplorer%2FMapping_Crisis%2Fcrisis%2Ffind
       
       -cd backend
   
      - npm install
      - npm start



### To run the front end
